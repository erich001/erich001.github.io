Post-doc positions are available in my new lab, please contact me for more information. I am currently a Post-doc in [Wallis Lab](http://www.wallislab.org/) at the University of California Berkeley, and collaborate with the [Chang Lab](http://changlab.ucsf.edu/our-team-1/) at the University of California San Francisco.\r\n\r\n### Research\r\nMy research focuses on understanding the biological basis of complex behavior and cognition. I am particularly interested in how affective processing - in other words how much you do or don't like something - interacts with cognitive and perceptual processing to give rise to learning, memory and decision-making. My principal approach is recording neurophysiological signals from the brain while a subject engages in tasks that tax these abilities.    \r\n\r\n",
